**_Because a picture is worth a thousand words_**

docpicture's goal is to enable embedding pictures inside Python docstrings using some custom domain specific language (dsl).  docpicture includes a plugin architecture enabling users to extend it by adding new dsl parsers.

docpicture's directives use a syntax similar to docutils directives which should make it easier to port features from one to the other.
